# Data Engineering nano-degree - STEDI App Data Analysis

As a data engineer on the STEDI Step Trainer team,  need to extract the data produced by the STEDI Step Trainer sensors and the mobile app, and curate them into a data lakehouse solution on AWS so that Data Scientists can train the learning model.


### Project Data
STEDI has three JSON data sources(opens in a new tab) to use from the Step Trainer. Check out the JSON data in the following folders in the Github repo:

- customer
- step_trainer
- accelerometer

### Project Workflow

Using AWS Glue, AWS S3, Python, and Spark, create or generate Python scripts to build a lakehouse solution in AWS that satisfies these requirements from the STEDI data scientists
